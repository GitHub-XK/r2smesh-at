RECIPE TO START USING THIS R2S IMPLEMENTATION
===============================================

First, define `R2S_ROOT` variable, which points to this folder. This can be done by 
e.g. adding the following line to the `~/.profile`::

    export R2S_ROOT=/path/to/this/folder


Create working place containing the following files::

    input/meshtal.fine            # meshtal with neutron flux intensities
    input/meshtal.coarse          # meshtal with neutron spectra
    input/fine_mesh_content       # material allocatiaon in the mesh
    input/mat_table               # Material compositions
    input/cmi_table               # Cell and material indices, names and densities.
    input/inventory_input_footer  # Irradiation scenario in fispact format.

    r2s_env.sh                    # script to setup environment variables

In the simplest case, only one of these files must be prepared by hands: this
is the file containing irradiation scenario `input/inventory_input_footer`. The
other files are obtained by processing MCNP output files. 

Files `meshtal.fine` and `meshtal.coarse` are parts of the meshtal files, 
as generated by MCNP5
