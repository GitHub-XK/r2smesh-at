# KIT implementation, Dec 2017
This implementation is written from scratch, but in some aspects mimics the original R2Smesh.

A short recipe how to start can be found in the [recipe](doc/recipe.rst).


# Note for collaborators
Current github policy allows only two types of access rights for private repositories, owned by a user account: (1) the owner and (2) the collaborator. Both have rights to write directly to the repository. 

Instead of directly introducing changes to this repository, the proposed way for collaborators is to fork this repository, make chages to the forked repo and make pull requests from the forked repo to this one. In this way only accepted pull requests (i.e. reviewed code changes) will appear here.

Contact the owner (currently <anton.travleev@kit.edu>) for any questions.
