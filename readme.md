# Origin
This implementation is written from scratch, but in some aspects mimics the
R2Smesh developed in KIT/INR in 2005 (?) -- 2014.

A short recipe how to start calculations can be found in the
[recipe](doc/recipe.rst) and [deploy](/deploy.rst).



# Note for collaborators
Current github policy allows only two types of access rights for private
repositories, owned by a user account: (1) the owner and (2) the collaborator.
Both have rights to write directly to the repository. 

Instead of directly introducing changes to this repository, the proposed way
for collaborators is to fork this repository, make chages to the forked repo
and make pull requests from the forked repo to this one. In this way only
accepted pull requests (i.e. reviewed code changes) will appear here.

Contact the owner (currently <anton.travleev@gmail.com>) for any questions.
