Verification problem on improvement of spatial resolution

Consider a rectangular homogen. material irradiated with flux \Phi(r, E, t) = \phi(r) * f(E) * g(t),
i.e. the spectra does depend neither on spatial coordinate nor on time. 

A series of problems are considered, which differ by the spatial resolution of the representation of the
flux intensity \phi(r). In the 1-st problem in the series, the spatial resolution is a constant representing the mean value
